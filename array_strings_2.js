Output: 4
  
---------------

3. Write down a function which will receive an array of numbers and remove duplicates from it (using Set)
Input: [1, 3, 5, 2, 5, 2, 6]
Output: [1, 3, 5, 2, 6]

4. Create an implementation of the rotational cipher, also sometimes called the Caesar cipher. 
The Caesar cipher is a simple shift cipher that relies on transposing all the letters in the alphabet using an 
integer key between 0 and 26. Using a key of 0 or 26 will always yield the same output due to modular arithmetic. 
The letter is shifted for as many values as the value of the key.

1. Encode function
  Input: abc, 1
  Output: bcd

  Input: Hello world, 7
  Output Olssv dvysk

2. Decode function
  Input: Olssv dvysk, 7
  Output: Hello world

  Input: bcd, 1
  Output: abc
  
---------------

5. Write down a function which will print the number of the rest seconds untill the current day's end.
Example: if current time is 23:59:45 function should print 15
Example: if current time is 23:50:45 function should print 555
